# predictive-rl
Everything to reproduce reinforcement learning experiments done in my [Master's thesis](https://github.com/rihardsk/rlthesis).
For now you'll have to find your way around by yourself. In time i'll try to come up with some documentation.
Use together with https://github.com/rihardsk/predictive-rl_envs
