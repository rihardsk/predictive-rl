# predictive-rl
Everything to reproduce reinforcement learning experiments done
in my [Master's thesis](https://github.com/rihardsk/rlthesis).
For now you'll have to find your way around by yourself. In
time i'll try to come up with some documentation.

## Installation
The following packages are required:
* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
* [RL-Glue](http://glue.rl-community.org/)
* [configobj](https://github.com/DiffSK/configobj)

To run the environments you will also have to set up
[rihardsk/predictive-rl_envs](https://github.com/rihardsk/predictive-rl_envs)
